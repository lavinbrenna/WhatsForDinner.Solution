_What's For Dinner?_

### Project's Purpose or Goal

Help plan dinners using meals you already know that you like. I often forget about my go to meals because I often try to find new recipes, but I want to be able to meal plan using the recipes I already know and like, and want to keep all of the recipe information in one place instead of having 100 tabs always open in my phone, or having 5 different notes in my notes app.

#### List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal

* This project must allow a user to generate at least 2 weeks worth of meals based on frequency preferences
* must allow a user to store recipe information.
* user login

#### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP

* React
* JavaScript
* Firebase
* CSS
* maybe another react styling tool like tailwind, semantic ui, or material UI.
* Also considering writing this app using a Python stack : Python, Flask, React
* Adobe XD
* Figma

#### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here

* Reshuffle week button.
* Allow user to categorize meals based on their own categorization of healthy, normal and unhealthy meals
* A user should be able to skip certain meals and then if the user has skipped the meal more than twice, they should be asked to re-evaluate the frequency that they want that meal.
* Allow user to create a grocery list using a tag system for when the user creates the recipe. Maybe allow user to import recipe information from URLs

#### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require

* Spoonacular API
* [Spoonacular's Extract Recipe from Website feature](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Extract-Recipe-from-Website)
