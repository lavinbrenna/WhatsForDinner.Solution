### Project's Purpose or Goal

Help plan dinners using meals you already know that you like. I often forget about my go to meals because I often try to find new recipes, but I want to be able to meal plan using the recipes I already know and like, and want to keep all of the recipe information in one place instead of having 100 tabs always open in my phone, or having 5 different notes in my notes app.
