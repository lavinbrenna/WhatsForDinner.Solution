## Technologies Used

* C#

## Description

If you hate trying to figure out what you're going to eat, and you also hate using meal planning apps that try to give you new recipes to that you've never even thought of eating, then use this app! This app allows you to store your own recipes and create meal plans for breakfast, lunch, dinner or for all three. Enter in your recipe information, and how many times per week you'd ideally like to eat that meal and you're good to go!

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* To use this app you need MySQL and MySQL Workbench installed. Follow setup instructions [here](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/getting-started-with-c/installing-and-configuring-mysql).
* Clone this repository to your local machine
* In the root folder, create an ```appsettings.json``` file with the following code:

  ``` json

  {
  "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=whatsfordinner;uid=root;pwd={YOURPASSWORDHERE};"
    }
  }
  ```

* Replace {YOURPASSWORDHERE} with the password you used when setting up MySQL
* Save this file then navigate to the main project folder by typing ```cd WhatsForDinner``` in your terminal
* type dotnet restore into the terminal to install the project's necessary dependencies.
* type ```dotnet ef database update``` into the terminal to ensure the database is properly connected.
* to run the app, type ```dotnet run``` into the terminal.
* Enjoy!
